# video_team_interviews
This is a repro for coding exercises for video team interviews.  We should organize these by the technology we are testing candidates on.  They should contain reference implementations we use to compare against the candidate's work and  if applicable, they should contain a header or stubbed function we give the candidate to implement.

Also store standard questions with acceptable answers.
